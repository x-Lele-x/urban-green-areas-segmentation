# urban-green-areas-segmentation
This project was made to experiment urban green area segmentation from UAV imagery using pseudo-labeling and deep learning. Comparison between a classical SRM baseline and an edge-aware pipeline (K-Means + Sobel), with ~400 generated pseudo-labels used to train a U-Net for binary vegetation mapping.
